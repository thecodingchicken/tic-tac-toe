# tic-tac-toe
Play a game of tic-tac-toe against another player
The game uses a 2D list.
The function, "game" works, and you can play against other people.
The function, "gameAI" doesn't work.
  The computer can "cheat".  It trys to see if it can win, and if it can, it does.
  Otherwise, it trys to see if you can win, and it blocks it.
  
  After doing one of those(if it can)
  it does a "random" move based on a simple algorithm.
 
Therefore, it cheats and can do two moves
